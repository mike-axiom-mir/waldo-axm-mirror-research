# WALDO — AXM/Mirror Research Fork

[![Apache License 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-3b82f6)](LICENSE) ![Status experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-f59e0b) ![Research fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/repository-research%20fork-8b5cf6)

This repository is an experimental AXM/Mirror research fork of [OpenWALDO](https://github.com/openwaldo/waldo). It explores inspectable AI development through model and dataset provenance, behavioural evidence, dissent preservation, permission boundaries, portable experience, and user-owned local operation.

It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the OpenWALDO maintainers.

## Current truth

- `main` still preserves the upstream WALDO foundation described below.
- AXM/Mirror experiments remain separated in reviewable draft pull requests; they are not silently presented as merged or CANON.
- The latest visible cumulative research lane is [PR #30 — WALDO v0.51 website creation experience loop](https://github.com/mike-axiom-mir/waldo-axm-mirror-research/pull/30).
- This repository makes no blanket claim of intelligence, safety, autonomy, or production readiness.
- Private experience, personal saves, model weights, secrets, and local continuity do not belong in the public repository.

## Upstream WALDO foundation

WALDO is a command-line tool for building auditable AI training datasets and
models. It connects a Git-governed corpus index, content-addressed Parquet
objects, and model artifacts with verifiable bills of materials (BOMs).

WALDO is under active development. It is being opened early so users and
contributors can help shape the project through frequent, incremental
releases. Expect interfaces and formats outside the documented compatibility
contract to evolve.

## What works today

- Inspect, verify, audit, ingest, update, and export indexed corpora.
- Read and publish canonical Parquet objects through local or S3 lookaside
  storage.
- Create corpus, training-run, model, and release provenance records.
- Forecast and train models through MLX, PyTorch, or single-node TorchTitan
  when the required runtime is installed.
- Export native WALDO, Hugging Face, MLX, GGUF, and Ollama packages.

WALDO does not prove that a license assertion is legally correct, that model
output is safe, or that a generated disclosure alone establishes regulatory
compliance. It records attributable facts and verifies artifact identity.

## Build

WALDO requires Go 1.25 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwaldo/waldo.git
cd waldo
go install ./cmd/waldo
waldo --help
```

`go install` writes the executable to `GOBIN`, or to `GOPATH/bin` when
`GOBIN` is unset. That directory must be on `PATH`.

## First steps

With no configured index, read-only index commands use a managed checkout at
`~/.waldo/index`:

```bash
waldo index list
waldo index summary
waldo index verify --offline
```

Contributing data requires a separate writable index checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwaldo/waldo-index.git
waldo config set index /path/to/waldo-index
waldo config set lookaside file:///tmp/waldo-lookaside
waldo index ingest --help
```

Use `waldo <command> --help` as the authoritative command reference.
