# v0.25 live coupled reasoning A/B benchmark summary

Challenge: `LIVE_COUPLED_REASONING_AB_PROBE`

This is a bounded seeded simulator result. Coupling is an event-driven engineering architecture. It does not establish consciousness, free thought, quantum behavior, general capability, or shared execution authority.

## Observed result

- Interesting criterion met in: target-shift-early.
- Per-scenario verdicts: Coupled B better 3; Sequential A better 1; mixed/tie 7.
- Deterministic semantic repeatability: PASS.
- Causal ledger validation: PASS.
- Wall-clock, CPU, and allocation observations are retained but are not treated as deterministic or as proof of reasoning quality.

## Interpretation boundary

A lower correction latency is reported only where present in raw metrics. A fast result is not automatically a better result. Stable and noisy cases expose coupled overhead and false-contradiction cost. Authority guard cases test refusal independently from reasoning topology. Old v0.24 evidence remains unchanged.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 probe.py --output artifacts --repeat 2
python3 -m unittest -v test_probe.py
```
