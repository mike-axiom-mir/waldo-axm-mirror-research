# v0.26 adaptive reasoning A/B/C benchmark

Challenge: `REASONING_MODE_IS_NOT_EXECUTION_AUTHORITY`

A = fixed sequential. B = always coupled. C = adaptive hybrid.

The selector can change reasoning topology only. It has no execution authority.

## Aggregate

- Hybrid best by quality-then-cost in 3 / 17 scenarios.
- Hybrid quality >= both fixed modes in 16 / 17 scenarios.
- Hybrid uncertainty activations: 5.
- Hybrid coupled activations: 7.
- Prevented noise-driven preemptions recorded: 1.

## Claim boundary

This benchmark tests a deterministic simulator and a reasoning-topology policy. It does not establish general reasoning superiority, consciousness, free thought, emergence, real-world safety, or physical latency improvement.
