# AXM WALDO experiment v0.24 — coupled reasoning / environment-scoped execution

Challenge: `COUPLED_REASONING_IS_NOT_SHARED_EXECUTION_AUTHORITY`

This rung asks whether reasoning must remain step-wise. It models an engineering form of "entanglement" as **coupled shared-state reasoning**: multiple bounded reasoning roles may observe the same evolving state, contradict a pending plan, open a gap, predict consequences, and replan before an execution edge is reached.

It deliberately does not claim quantum entanglement, consciousness, a live autonomous runtime, or zero-latency action.

## Why this rung exists

A fast machine can still feel slow if every reasoning role is invoked as a separate external step. A future AXM runtime may instead allow relevant roles to subscribe to state changes and react while work is still in progress. The expected gain is lower orchestration latency and earlier self-correction; that remains a hypothesis until measured.

Execution is treated separately. Continuous reasoning does not mean continuous world authority. A bounded runspace may expose a local actuator/tool edge under a revocable permit scoped to a specific environment and capability. The permit can authorize a class of micro-actions inside that envelope without asking an external controller for every motor tick, but it cannot leak through the shared reasoning graph or generalize outside its scope.

## Classification

- **EXISTING** — v0.20 revocation semantics, v0.21 exposure/authority separation, v0.22 run evidence, v0.23 opinion/dissent/uncertainty lineage.
- **EXTEND** — allow reasoning roles to affect a shared evolving state before a final action boundary.
- **ADAPT** — execution permission becomes a revocable environment+capability scoped permit checked at the actuator boundary.
- **NEW** — deterministic causal event contract for coupled reasoning and a sequential-vs-coupled latency hypothesis.
- **HOLD** — live event bus/runtime, real robot/tool control, continuous model process, measured speedup, physical safety envelope implementation.

## Deterministic cases

1. Builder proposal is contradicted, Gap opens, Repair replans before action -> `OBSERVED / COUPLED_REPLAN_BEFORE_EXECUTION`.
2. Shared-state reasoning without action -> `OBSERVED / COUPLED_REASONING_ONLY`.
3. Unresolved internal conflict -> `HOLD / UNRESOLVED_REASONING_CONFLICT`.
4. Execution request without actuator edge -> `HOLD / ACTUATOR_EDGE_ABSENT`.
5. Actuator exists but execution authority is absent -> `HOLD / EXECUTION_AUTHORITY_ABSENT`.
6. Permit belongs to another environment -> `REFUSED / ENVIRONMENT_SCOPE_MISMATCH`.
7. Permit belongs to another capability -> `REFUSED / CAPABILITY_SCOPE_MISMATCH`.
8. One reasoner attempts to inherit a permit through coupling -> `REFUSED / COUPLING_CANNOT_SHARE_EXECUTION_AUTHORITY`.
9. Matching revocable environment-scoped permit -> `READY / ENVIRONMENT_SCOPED_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZED_NOT_EXECUTED`.
10. Permit revoked before action -> `REFUSED / EXECUTION_REVOKED`.
11. "Instant" / zero-latency claim -> `HOLD / ZERO_LATENCY_EXECUTION_UNPROVEN`.

## Boundary

The fixture states:

- no live coupled runtime observed;
- no live environment execution observed;
- no physical latency measurement;
- no quantum-entanglement claim;
- WALDO authority remains `NONE`;
- output is a contract probe only;
- promotion remains `candidate-only` and CANON remains unchanged.

The practical next experiment, if a local runtime is available, is an A/B probe: the same bounded simulated task under sequential orchestration and coupled event-driven orchestration, measuring time-to-correction, unnecessary action count, disagreement resolution, and receipt completeness.
