The earlier full `./testing/all.sh` run was stopped during the fake-model lifecycle after its Go, static-analysis, direct-ingestion, recipe-ingestion, structured-conversation, and positive-ground phases passed. A complete full-suite result is therefore not claimed.

No website source, browser render, repair loop, training run, or weight update occurred because no WALDO neural source candidate, installed PyTorch/MLX backend, or trainable WALDO checkpoint was available to this machine run. The incomplete attempt nevertheless produced both retained observed experience and a trainable outcome-conditioned reflection projection; completion was not required.
