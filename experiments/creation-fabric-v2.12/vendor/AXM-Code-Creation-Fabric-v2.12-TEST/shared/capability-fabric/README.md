# AXM Capability Fabric v1

Capability Fabric is the Workshop's deterministic **how** layer. It compiles a
reviewed, digest-bound build request through one exact source-reviewed recipe
into a detached capability candidate. Ordinary builds require no provider,
model, API key, network request, or repeated reasoning compute.

The composition layer can bind two to sixteen reviewed candidate builds into a
bounded directed acyclic graph. Every edge must name one exact contract emitted
by its source and consumed by its target. Root inputs, expected outputs, node
and edge ceilings, aggregate package bytes, topological order, runtime modes,
and required host capabilities are digest-bound in the composition plan.

The existing Deterministic Organ Fabric remains the reused declarative kernel
and specialized compatibility surface. This layer adds a generic recipe
catalog and complete candidate materialization for modular capabilities.
`HAND` recipes bind one explicit source language, entry path, and selftest path;
legacy JavaScript HANDs remain `capability.js` plus `selftest.js`, while the
first Python lane binds `capability.py` plus `selftest.py`. `SKILL` recipes bind
portable `SKILL.md` plus an explicit instruction-only, host-mediated, or
executable runtime. Kind and artifact layout are digest-bound from recipe
through plan, compilation, candidate, module contract, and receipt.

## Truth boundary

- One candidate is built by default. A recipe contract can explicitly declare
  variants and must name its default variant without turning ranking into
  authority. Variant overrides are resolved and validated during planning.
- Missing, ambiguous, inactive, invalid, unreviewed, or resource-exceeding work
  returns a typed hold.
- Imported Mirror, Code Fabric, AI, or external recipes remain inactive
  proposals until source review and Mike's merge decision. Proposal drafts use
  a separate inactive schema and cannot claim active-recipe status.
- Generated tests are files in the candidate. Capability Fabric does not
  execute generated code.
- Candidates remain `EXPERIMENTAL`, detached, uninstalled, unregistered,
  unstaged, unpromoted, and non-CANON.
- The Detached Candidate Nursery may prove structural readiness for later
  intake. That is not runtime, visual, safety, installation, or CANON proof.
- Candidate verification checks byte lineage and the authority-bearing package,
  manifest, compilation receipt, candidate receipt, and module contract. A
  self-consistent rehash cannot convert detached material into authority.

## Core contracts

- `axm.capability-build-receipt/v1`
- `axm.capability-recipe-proposal/v1`

- `axm.capability-composition.plan/v1`
- `axm.capability-composition.build/v1`
- `axm.capability-composition.verification/v1`

## Composition truth boundary

- Composition proves exact declared contract identity, acyclic order, child
  request/recipe/builder/package lineage, resource ceilings, and deterministic
  rebuild parity.
- It does not claim that equal contract labels guarantee runtime payload
  semantics. Node selftests and end-to-end behavior require separate trusted
  host execution and evidence.
- A host-mediated `SKILL` remains host-mediated inside a graph. Its required
  host capabilities are surfaced in the plan and never inherited as authority.
- A held graph emits no partial candidate set. The Fabric never executes a node,
  installs output, changes permissions, promotes material, touches Foundation,
  or changes CANON.

The reviewed catalog contains six executable `HAND` recipes—a closed JSON
Schema validator, a pure JSON transform, a static semantic HTML-page renderer,
an SVG status-badge creation hand, a Workshop Direction hand-request adapter,
and one bounded Python record transform—plus one host-mediated portable `SKILL` for bounded evidence-first
capability review. The HTML renderer is source-reviewed on its review branch;
shared use still requires Mike's merge decision and visual behavior remains
unproven until a separate authorized browser run. The Python source and
selftest remain inert; runtime behavior is unproven until a separately
authorized disposable-sandbox run.

Builder implementations now live behind a digest-bound modular registry.
Recipes, plans, candidate packages, and verification all bind the exact active
builder digest. The Foundry validator HAND entered the active registry through
the deterministic admission gate after exact packet inspection, trusted tests,
nine-case source review, and Mike's merge decision. The portable review SKILL
entered through the same route and remains instruction material: its authorized
host must re-check every capability and permission at use time. No review
authority is inherited. The registry now also carries one exact inactive
`closed-object-contract-adapter-v1` review candidate. Ordinary Fabric builds
cannot compile it; its source, structural-versus-semantic boundary, evidence,
and catalog diff still require the full admission route and Mike's decision.
`tools/capability-recipe-admission-gate` has no apply or activation action.
