# Closed Object Contract Adapter — inactive recipe review packet

Status: `EXPERIMENTAL` · activation: `INACTIVE_PROPOSAL`
Kind: `HAND` · runtime: `EXECUTABLE`

Build a deterministic bounded object-contract adapter that makes every copied, renamed, defaulted, and dropped top-level field explicit without claiming domain meaning from structural compatibility.

This packet binds one exact capability specification and verification plan to one authored builder contribution and one Capability Fabric recipe draft.

## Review route

1. Inspect `capability-specification.json` and `verification-plan.json`.
2. Review `builder-contribution.js` line by line.
3. In an explicitly authorized test host, run `node builder-contribution.selftest.js`.
4. Record independent evidence against `review-checklist.json`.
5. If evidence is sufficient, prepare a separate reviewed Capability Fabric source/catalog diff.
6. Mike remains the merge and CANON gate.

The Foundry did not execute the builder or generated code. This packet does not install, register, stage, promote, activate, mutate Foundation, grant permission, or change CANON.
