# Deterministic Organ Fabric

This workbench remains the specialized three-strategy organ surface. The
broader `tools/capability-fabric` front door reuses its deterministic kernel for
exact recipe builds across code, creation hands, and contract adapters.

`EXPERIMENTAL` additive factory for pure, bounded JSON-in/JSON-out organs. The normal path is deterministic and needs no AI, network, API key, provider, model, randomness, install, promotion, or Foundation mutation.

Every hard-gate-valid candidate is retained as `VALID_DORMANT_LIBRARY`, `KEEP_WHEN_NO_CURRENT_USE`, `ARCHIVED_NOT_ADMITTED_TO_RUNTIME`, and `DORMANT`. This is the shelf for a capable organ that has no direct use yet. “Valid” means its declared deterministic contract and fixtures passed; usefulness, taste, fun, wisdom, and broader quality remain unresolved human judgments.

Selection is a durable event overlay. Typed supersession receipts preserve prior selections as `HISTORICAL_SUPERSEDED` while the rebuildable index exposes only the current choice as selected. Neither event mutates immutable candidate objects or removes dormant candidates. Every candidate stays detached with `installed`, `registered`, `staged`, `promoted`, and `canonChanged` set to `false`.

Software & Workshop v1.1 reads every declared affected surface through the bounded `stable_lookup_union` runtime primitive. Unknown surfaces refuse; reordered equivalent surface sets produce the same route. Every emitted verification token is bound to the exact packaged `axm.verification-route-token-registry/v1`, which names an Evidence Desk claim kind, native proof surface, pass condition, and optional Verification Spine claim.

The pure machine action `verification.route.plan` accepts an intact current candidate plus a typed change brief and emits `axm.verification-route-plan/v1` with an Evidence Desk prefill. It executes only the trusted in-memory declarative runtime; it never imports generated `organ.js`, runs checks, controls a browser, writes state, installs, registers, stages, promotes, changes CANON, or mutates the Foundation.

The Hub, CLI `plan-selected`, and machine action `verification.route.plan-selected` use the admitted balanced organ in `selected-verification-route-organ.contract.json`. Each call rebuilds the exact intent, run, comparison, package, and selection digests before evaluating the definition in the trusted runtime. Output includes an Evidence Desk v2 prefill and exact Verification Spine mappings; all claims remain `UNKNOWN` until their native proof surfaces are actually used.

The second admitted implementation is the balanced Creative Production route organ in `selected-creative-production-route-organ.contract.json`. The Hub, CLI `plan-selected-creative`, and machine action `creative.production.plan-selected` accept an explicit medium, delivery context, and accessibility tasks. They return ordered production steps, mechanical validators, and accessible fallbacks. They do not generate an asset, execute validators, perform human review, make a taste or quality claim, or write state.

`stash-export` emits a content-bound `axm.organ-archive-stash-envelope/v1` containing the standalone `organ.js` source under an `organs/*-organ.js` suggested path. It remains a detached handoff and performs no write.

`connect-mirror` is the explicit host-authorized bridge. It is bound to AI Organ Archive `0.9.0` TEST contract digest `sha256:42a91fd899191dfb6ded2f54074d874cbc20c7d7a020c082a252775eaae254da` and the exact passive receiver entry-point bytes. It refuses missing authorization, lineage drift, symlinks, overlap, traversal, or different bytes at the target. With the exact acknowledgement, it places the source, invokes only the trusted archive receiver (never the organ), verifies the predicted content-addressed object and dormant/non-admitted state, and records `axm.organ-archive-connection-receipt/v1` as a durable Fabric event. Repeating the exact connection deduplicates both source and event.

This “connection” is archive plumbing only. `runtimeConnected`, `organLoaded`, `organExecuted`, `runtimeAdmitted`, `installed`, `registered`, `staged`, `promoted`, and `canonChanged` remain `false`. Receiver contract or entry-point changes produce a revalidation refusal until the bridge is deliberately updated.
