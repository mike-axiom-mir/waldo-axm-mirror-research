# Capability Fabric workbench

This is the human and machine front door for
`shared/capability-fabric`. The browser workbench validates, plans, builds in
memory, and offers an explicit deterministic ZIP download. `machine.js`
exposes the same pure operations without filesystem authority.

Every recipe and candidate is explicitly typed as `HAND` or `SKILL`. Active v1
recipes include six reviewed executable `HAND` builders and one reviewed
host-mediated portable `SKILL` builder.

Builder code is no longer selected by hard-coded branches in the Fabric core.
A digest-bound modular registry supplies all seven active builders. The validator,
semantic HTML renderer, and bounded Python record-transform HAND are all selected
through exact recipe and builder digests. The generated Python source and its
selftest remain inert candidate data and are not executed by this workbench. The
portable review SKILL was admitted through the reviewed merge gate. The
separate Capability Recipe Admission Gate can prove exact evidence and a
prospective catalog diff for future candidates, but cannot activate one itself.

The registry also exposes one exact inactive object-contract adapter review
candidate to Recipe Foundry. Normal Fabric builds cannot compile it. The
candidate makes copied, renamed, defaulted, and dropped fields explicit and
proves only structural output compatibility; source review and Mike's merge
decision remain required before catalog activation.

The v0.2 composition door deterministically connects reviewed candidates through
exact `consumes` / `provides` identities. It refuses cycles, self-edges,
duplicate or ambiguous bindings, unbound inputs, undeclared outputs, unavailable
child builds, and node/edge/byte budget excess. Its evidence route explicitly
keeps runtime payload semantics, node tests, host authority, and end-to-end
behavior unproven until checked on their native surfaces.

Explicit local materialization is CLI-only:

```text
node tools/capability-fabric/cli.js build \
  --request capability-request.json \
  --output-parent /existing/detached-candidate-parent
```

Composition validation, planning, and explicit materialization use:

```text
node tools/capability-fabric/cli.js compose-validate --request composition.json
node tools/capability-fabric/cli.js compose-plan --request composition.json
node tools/capability-fabric/cli.js compose-build \
  --request composition.json \
  --output-parent /existing/detached-composition-parent
```

`compose-build` creates one fresh composition root with the sealed request,
plan, receipt, node-package index, and one independently verified candidate
folder per node. It reconstructs the complete build from disk and requires every
node to reach Nursery `READY_FOR_LATER_INTAKE`; any failure rolls back only that
fresh composition root.

The destination must not exist. Writes use new-file semantics, package bytes
are read back and verified, and the detached Nursery must report
`READY_FOR_LATER_INTAKE`. Generated `selftest.js` or `skill.selftest.js` is not
executed by the CLI.
If writing, readback, or Nursery inspection fails, the CLI removes only the
fresh candidate directory it created and preserves the explicit output parent.

That Nursery label is structural only. Run the emitted test from an explicit
trusted host entry point and obtain separate live visual evidence for creation
hands before making broader claims.
